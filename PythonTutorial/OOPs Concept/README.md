## Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 
1. **Class** - A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 
2. **Objects** - The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it.
3. **Polymorphism** - 
4. **Encapsulation** - It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.
5. **Inheritance** - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
6. **Data Abstraction** - It hides the unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.
Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes.

### __init__() Function: 
The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

### An object consists of :

**State:** It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.

**Behavior:** It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.

**Identity:** It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
